# Test project for ESP32c6 Touch

This branch is **NOT** working! Do not use!!!

This is the used [hardware](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-1.47>)

It uses a JD9853 LCD display driver, but that doesn't exists,
in the mipidsi driver for rust, so I'm currently running with
ILI9341Rgb565 driver.
